# Dysfunctional stand-up instructions

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dysfunctional Stand Up game, a playful way to explore behaviors which make a stand up meeting effective...or not. 

The game needs a minimum of two players and is best with four to eight.

## Overview

The associated cards each describe a dysfunction seen in the wild at a stand-up.  During the game players attend a mock stand-up and - whilst improvising other details - display that dysfunction.  

The aim of the game is not ‘to win’ per se; the aim is learn and explore how to run and contribute to effective stand-ups and for people to work together.  Part of the fun is providing just enough challenge that your fellow players find the game engaging and safe.

### Roles

Facilitator - Plays a person who leads the stand-up meeting, such as a scrum master.

Attendee - Plays a person attending the meeting, such as a team member.

### Other gear

You might find a timer, and a space where you can make some noise handy.

## Game formats

### Guess the dysfunction (Facilitator Mode)  

#### Game Objective: Facilitator must guess each dysfunction displayed by attendees

#### Game play

3. Facilitator holds the stand-up with the aim of achieving the typical purposes laid out as below.

4. Attendees contribute to the stand-up whilst acting out the dysfunction on the card.

5. The facilitator attempts to guess the dysfunction; when the player feels the guess is close enough, the player either leaves the stand up or continues without the dysfunction.

### Guess the dysfunction (Attendee mode)

## Purpose of a Stand Up

We assume a stand up meeting aims to:

1. Focus and coordinate activities towards goals

2. Clarify & consolidate immediate goals 

3. Highlight significant impediments, risks and opportunities

4. Build relationships

The game is based on a set of good stand-up traits, listed below. Dysfunctions in the game will undermine one or more these desirable traits.

### Traits of a successful stand-up:

#### Achievement of Purpose - it must achieve the above purpose, how that happens is just as important:

* **Focus** - On the work and each other

* **Brevity** (or succinctness) - Of each person's contribution, responses and the meeting itself

* **Autonomy** - The meeting serves the team.  The team have the autonomy to choose the format and style

* **Safety** - The meeting should uphold psychological safety, which encourages a collaborative environment.  This includes both being sensitive to others and enabling contribution (should they wish) from all participants

* **Timely** - Focused on the immediate work, challenges and goals.  Start on time, finish when done  

* **Attendee** - Attendees should have a strong motivation for attending, which is likely to be a need to contribute to or understand work

* **Energy** - We’re about to go and do great things, let’s build energy

* **Connectivity**- Needs to be effective for remote attendees
